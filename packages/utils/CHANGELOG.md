## 0.0.0-alpha.3

### Minor Changes

- [`8de6038`](https://github.com/trajs-ai/trajs/commit/8de60386eccdf99d6f78e5f1a4a050ea79213eba) Thanks [@observerw](https://github.com/observerw)! - A compression and a hash no longer state the algorithm they carry or digest with.
  `Compression.algorithm` and `StreamHash.algorithm` are removed. `Compression.compress`,
  `Compression.decompress` and `StreamHash.digest` take the algorithm as the option of
  the call (`Compression.Options`, `StreamHash.Options`). One service writes, reads and
  digests with every algorithm its platform states.
  `NodeCompression.layer`, `BunCompression.layer`, `BrowserCompression.layer`,
  `NodeStreamHash.layer`, `BrowserStreamHash.layer`, `StreamHash.layer` and
  `StreamHash.make` take no algorithm. `Options` is removed from `NodeServices`,
  `BunServices` and `BrowserServices`, and their `layer` is a constant layer.
  
  `Exchange.save` takes an `Exchange.SaveOptions`, the options of the compression and
  of the hash used for the write. It records both algorithms in the metadata it writes.
  `Exchange.load` reads a frame back in the algorithm of the metadata, not the
  algorithm of the compression. A trajectory written in gzip, deflate or no frame at
  all loads through a compression provided with no option.
